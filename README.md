Timeline: 

* 03/04/2020: As you suggested, we have finished the detection of GSA chip for 27 SLE patients. We wonder if you could help us do the further analysis for the association of the risk SNP and level of IL-4 in plasma. Attached are the documents, including the result of GAS chip, the plasma level of IL-4 and the brief introduction of this project

S: SLE patients; MN: IgM+ Naive B cells; BN: IgM- Anergic B cells( That is also BND cell in our paper); We have a total of eight individuals (HC1,HC2,HC3,HC4,S1,S2,S3ï¼ŒS4),  each with two cell groups(MN and BN).
